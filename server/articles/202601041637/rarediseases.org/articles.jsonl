This legislation has broad bipartisan support, is budget-neutral, and has a proven track record of accelerating the development of treatments for children who often have no other options.\n\nAllowing this bill to expire slows and risks halting progress for families who are already waiting far too long for diagnoses and therapies. For children with rare diseases, delays are not abstract. They are measured in irreversible losses of physical body functions, neurological damage, time, and life itself.\n\nAt a time when our nation needs leaders to come together and set aside differences to do what is right, it is unfortunate that this opportunity was missed. This could have been a meaningful victory for more than 30 million Americans living with rare diseases.\n\nWhen the Senate returns in January, NORD will be back on Capitol Hill working with lawmakers in both chambers to move this legislation forward without delay. The rare disease community has been clear, consistent, and united. We urge Congress to act swiftly to ensure that children with rare diseases are not left behind.", "url": "https://rarediseases.org/statement-from-pamela-gavin-ceo-national-organization-for-rare-disorders-nord-on-the-senate-failure-to-approve-the-give-kids-a-chance-act-by-year-end/", "summary": "Posted December 18, 2025 by NORD\n\nThe Senate’s failure to advance the Give Kids a Chance Act through unanimous consent is deeply disappointing.\n\nFor more than a year, thousands of rare disease advocat...", "source_website": "rarediseases.org", "scraped_at": "2026-01-04T16:35:24.726414", "content_length": 1543}
{"title": "NORD CEO Statement on the Addition of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel", "date": "2025-12-16", "author": "Connor Rice", "categories": ["Advocacy", "Featured News", "Newborn Screening"], "content": "Posted December 16, 2025 by NORD\n\nNewborn Screening\n\nThe National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauds the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for addingmetachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)andDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). MLD and DMD are both serious rare conditions that have taken the lives of too many children and young adults.\n\nNewborn screening is a vital public health program with a long history of successful operation in the United States. Over 14,000 newborns are found to have a serious but treatable rare disorder through newborn screening each year.1Babies affected by these conditions appear healthy at birth, and families are often unaware that anything is wrong until after a child becomes symptomatic. Screening shortly after birth will allow for early detection and intervention, a move that will save lives and give newborns affected by MLD and DMD the best shot at a healthy life. We congratulate the leukodystrophy and muscular dystrophy communities, whose tireless advocacy has driven these nominations forward through months of uncertainty.\n\nWhile newborn screening programs operate at the state/territory level, the federal government plays a critical role in supporting efficiency and transparency for our nation’s newborn screening system. States ultimately determine which conditions are screened as part of their respective newborn screening programs, but inclusion on the RUSP is an important step in ensuring newborns are universally screened for a particular condition. NORD is grateful for Secretary Kennedy’s decision to add MLD and DMD to the recommended panel, a decision that marks an important step toward universal screening for these two conditions across the country.\n\nIt is critical that the important work of evaluating nominations to the RUSP, reviewing evidence, and making recommendations to the Secretary does not end with these two conditions.\n\nWe are hopeful that the Administration will continue to hear the voice of the rare community, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to work with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to determine a path forward for this lifesaving work. As new treatments and improved screening methods become available, we must ensure thatall newborns born in the United States can benefit from early detection and treatment.\n\nTo build upon this momentum, NORD calls on Congress to build off this important milestone to further strengthen the nation’s newborn screening system by passing the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act.\n\nThis bipartisan legislation would strengthen and modernize the nation’s newborn screening system, provide long-term stability for the RUSP, and ensure that states, clinicians, and families have clear, consistent guidance. By codifying these efforts, Congress can help ensure that progress made today translates into durable, nationwide impact, so that every newborn, regardless of where they are born, has the same opportunity for early diagnosis and timely care.Advocates are encouraged to contact their lawmakers in support of this bill usingNORD’s action alert here.\n\nPamela GavinChief Executive OfficerNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n[1] Gaviglio A, McKasson S, Singh S, Ojodu J.
